  abstract  = "Comparison of millions of signatures in minutes, expertise in hundreds of languages, linking disparate intelligence — these are some of the promises of computing to forensic document examination. For this vision to happen, both computer scientists and forensic experts have to understand their partner’s professional field almost like anthropologists would do. In this book Vlad Atanasiu provides a set of keys to a cultural encounter by unveiling the sociotechnological landscape in which the scientists will evolve: players, needs, resources, and pitfalls. While maintaining a global perspective on forensic documents, the focus is on writing in all its forms. On the computing side, the book is rooted in the field of document image analysis.",
